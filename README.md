# Calendar-Challenge


#Description:
Calendar Challenge is my week 6 challenge, it contains time slots for your basic workday (8-6) and gives the user the ability to write down tasks to plan their day.

Each time slot is color coded so before time has passed, the time slot appears green and can still have tasks created within. After time has passed, tasks can no longer be created and time slot appears red.

At the top of the page displays the current Day, Month, Year for the user to easily know what day it is and what they may need to plan.


#Softwares:
Calendar Challenge is built with HTML, CSS, javascript with moment.js and jquery plugins added, and bootstrap.

Custom fonts have been added for enhancement of site.
